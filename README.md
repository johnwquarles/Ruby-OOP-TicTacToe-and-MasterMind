Ruby-OOP-TicTacToe-and-MasterMind
=================================
These are 2 games that I coded in Ruby as part of the Odin Project's Ruby programming course,
specifically for its object-oriented programming with Ruby project:

I'm reasonably happy with the Tic-Tac-Toe game, however the AI for MasterMind is quite stupid
because it only bases its guesses on the outcome of its (one) previous guess. It would be much
more formidable were it to compare all of its prior guesses and results before making new guesses,
but at this point I figure I'm better off leaving it as-is and moving on in my studies.
I may come back to it!

Another thing to improve on will be general organization of my files;
I think that in practice I'll be using different files and using "require" to connect them,
but for now I have everything in single files and had some difficulty determining whether I
should make sections of code modules, classes or just methods without a specific class defined for them.
